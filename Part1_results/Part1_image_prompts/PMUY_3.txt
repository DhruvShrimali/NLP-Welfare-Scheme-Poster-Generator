**Image Generation Prompt:**

Create an uplifting scene in a rural Indian village showcasing the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY). The main character, Shweta, is now standing in her small kitchen, beaming with joy and relief as she prepares a meal using a clean LPG stove. The kitchen is modest but neat, with light streaming through the windows, symbolizing a brighter future.

Shweta is depicted smiling as she stirs a pot on the stove, which is centrally placed and clearly visible, demonstrating the clean burning of LPG compared to the traditional methods. Around her, the walls are adorned with simple but colorful decorations made from local materials, adding warmth to the setting. 

Next to her, her children are playing happily, free from the harmful smoke that once surrounded their home, with one child holding a book, representing the newfound time for education and play. The atmosphere should be filled with clean air, emphasizing the health benefits gained from using LPG. 

In the background, you can see elements of agricultural aid, like a small vegetable garden flourishing with crops, representing sustainability and community support. A few neighbors, especially women, can be seen chatting and laughing through an open window, reinforcing the theme of community empowerment. 

The overall mood should be bright and cheerful, capturing the transformative impact of the PMUY scheme as Shweta and her family enjoy their improved quality of life through universal access to clean cooking fuel.

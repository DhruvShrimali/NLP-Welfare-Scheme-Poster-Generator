**Image Generation Prompt:**

Create an illustration that depicts "Raju the Aging Farmer," a senior citizen living in a rural Indian village. He appears deeply concerned as he tends to his small farm, which is surrounded by simple, humble houses and lush green crops. Rajuâ€™s expression reflects financial struggles, with visible worry etched on his face as he contemplates the rising costs of healthcare and the burden of chronic illnesses. 

In the background, include elements that convey limited access to medical facilities, such as a distant, dilapidated health clinic and an empty medicine shelf at his home. Show Raju holding a medical bill in one hand, contrasting it with his modest lifestyle, characterized by a worn-out pair of shoes and simple clothing. Emphasize the socio-economic vulnerability of his situation, capturing the essence of the challenges faced by senior citizens in accessing affordable healthcare services.

The scene should evoke empathy, highlighting the urgent need for support through initiatives like the AB PM-JAY scheme, which aims to alleviate these struggles and improve the quality of life for seniors like Raju.

**Image Generation Prompt:**

Create an image illustrating the application process for the PM-KISAN scheme, featuring Raju the farmer at a government registration desk in a rural setting. Raju looks hopeful as he fills out his application form on a digital device, with a friendly government official assisting him with a warm smile. 

Highlight the required documents on the desk, including a visible Aadhaar card, a bank passbook, and the application form. Around them, set the scene in a simple, well-lit government office that reflects local architecture, perhaps with a few potted plants or posters related to the PM-KISAN scheme on the walls.

Make sure to convey an atmosphere of support and accessibility, showing that the application process is straightforward and welcoming. Include elements that signify rural India, such as a traditional decorative lamp, comfortable wooden furniture, or a hint of a rural landscape visible through a window. Rajuâ€™s expression should convey a sense of optimism and relief, symbolizing his anticipation of the assistance he will receive to improve his family's agricultural livelihood.

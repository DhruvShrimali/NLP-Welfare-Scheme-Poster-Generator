**Image Generation Prompt:**

Create an image that illustrates the 'Application Process' for the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY). The scene should feature "Raju the Farmer," the same middle-aged man from a rural Indian village setting, as he engages with a friendly government official at a registration desk inside a government office. 

Raju should be depicted with a hopeful expression, highlighting the significance of enrolling in the scheme. He should be holding visible documents, such as his Aadhaar card and bank passbook, while a highlighted application form is placed on the counter in front of him. The registration desk should have a colorful banner representing the PMSBY scheme, making the setting inviting and informative.

The government official should be portrayed as approachable and supportive, helping Raju navigate the application process with a smile. Around them, include details of the office environment such as posters informing about insurance schemes and a digital device (like a tablet or computer) showing online application options, enhancing the sense of modernity and accessibility in the process.

Set against a backdrop that subtly reflects a blend of rural and government office elements, the scene should convey the ease of applying for the scheme, emphasizing how it empowers individuals like Raju to secure their financial future and that of their families.

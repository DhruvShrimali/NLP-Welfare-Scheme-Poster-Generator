**Image Generation Prompt:**

Create an engaging scene in a rural Indian village that illustrates the application process for the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY). The main character is Shweta, the housewife who previously struggled with traditional cooking fuels. She is now at a small government registration desk, looking hopeful and determined as she fills out the Know Your Customer (KYC) application form on a digital device. 

In her hands, she holds essential documents including her Aadhaar card, a bank passbook, and her ration card, all of which are partially visible to emphasize the application requirements. Next to her, a friendly government official is assisting her, with a warm smile, showcasing the supportive nature of the registration process. The backdrop is a simple government office with rustic decor, which reflects the rural setting of her village.

To reinforce the theme of accessibility, include other women in the background who are either waiting in line or conversing with officials. The scene should convey a sense of community and empowerment, as Shweta takes a step towards a better future for her family by applying for clean cooking fuel. The overall mood should be optimistic and hopeful, highlighting the positive impact of the PMUY scheme on the lives of women and families in rural India.

**Image Generation Prompt:**

Create an image depicting a rural Indian farmer named Raju standing in front of his small, modest house made of clay and thatch. Raju is visibly worried, his brow furrowed and eyes filled with concern as he looks over his small patch of land, which has sparse crops struggling to grow. 

Around him, include elements that illustrate his financial struggles, such as an empty sack that typically holds seeds, a broken water pump, and a small, old bicycle resting against the wall of the house. In the background, show a few other simple homes and a field that appears dry and in need of attention.

Make sure the setting has a clear sense of rural India—look for details like a dusty dirt road, a few farm animals, and distant hills—creating an atmosphere that conveys the challenges faced by farmer families relying on agriculture for their livelihood. Raju’s expression should evoke the stress of financial instability and worry about meeting his family’s needs before receiving support from the PM-KISAN scheme.

**Image Generation Prompt:**

Create an illustration depicting a rural setting that showcases the challenges faced by families, particularly focusing on a worried father, "Raju," who is sitting on a small, weathered wooden bench outside his modest home made of mud bricks. The surroundings feature lush, green fields that symbolize potential but also reveal the hard work that goes into farming. 

In the scene, Raju looks contemplative and distressed, gazing towards a small, open notebook in his hands where he jots down educational expenses for his daughter. Nearby, a modest kitchen garden is visible, with sparse crops and limited resources that reflect their financial struggles. 

Include a small child, his daughter, playing with a worn-out doll nearby, which underscores the family's hope for a better future. In the background, depict a simple village landscape with a few other homes, a distant school building, and a cloudy sky, symbolizing uncertainty. 

The overall mood of the image should convey a sense of worry and the need for financial security, illustrating the looming educational challenges that families face before the support of the Sukanya Samriddhi Account Scheme.

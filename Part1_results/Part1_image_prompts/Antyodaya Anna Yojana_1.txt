**Image Generation Prompt:**

Create an illustration depicting the challenges faced by beneficiaries of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana scheme in a rural Indian setting. Feature 'Raju the Farmer' standing in front of a small, modest house with a worried expression, surrounded by sparse crops and a barren field that highlights his financial struggles. 

In the background, include glimpses of the rural landscape: a couple of other simple houses, a few scattered farm animals, and a distant view of dry fields that emphasize the scarcity of resources. 

Capture the essence of food insecurity by showing an empty kitchen with minimal cooking utensils and no food supplies visible. Raju should appear contemplative, symbolizing the burden of providing for his family, with his worried face reflecting the urgency of the situation before the scheme's support.

Integrate subtle elements like a ration card in his pocket to symbolize hope for assistance, and maybe a fading sun setting in the background, representing the challenges of day-to-day living and the struggle against poverty.

Create a poignant scene in a rural Indian village, focusing on a woman named Shweta, a housewife and primary caregiver for her family. She is visibly distressed and concerned as she struggles with the challenges of using traditional cooking fuels. Shweta is depicted standing in front of a small, modest house made of mud and thatch, with smoke rising from a makeshift outdoor hearth where she is cooking. The hazy atmosphere is filled with dark smoke, highlighting the harmful effects of burning firewood and dried cow dung. 

In her hands, she holds a bundle of firewood, symbolizing the strenuous effort she puts into gathering fuel for cooking. Around her, there are elements like sparse crops in the fields, a few livestock, and a simple water well, emphasizing the limited resources available in her rural environment. 

Her worried expression reflects the health risks for her and her children, with one child nearby coughing gently, illustrating the impact of toxic smoke on their well-being.

**Image Generation Prompt:**

Create an illustration depicting 'Raju the Farmer,' a hardworking man in his early 30s, standing in a modest rural setting that represents the unorganised sector workers in India. Raju should have a worried expression on his face as he surveys his small farm, where crops appear sparse and undernourished. In the background, show simple houses made of mud and thatch, with a few livestock grazing nearby. 

The setting should evoke a sense of financial struggle, highlighting Raju's concerns about income security in his old age. You can include elements like a broken fence, a small, empty savings jar beside him, or a calendar hanging with past dates, symbolizing the passage of time without a safety net.

Incorporate subtle visual cues, like a distant bank branch or an advertisement for the Atal Pension Yojana, indicating the possible support that remains out of reach for him due to his current circumstances. Overall, focus on conveying the emotional weight of his situation, illustrating the challenges faced by beneficiaries of the APY scheme before they receive support.

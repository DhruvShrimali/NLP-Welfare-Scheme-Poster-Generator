**Image Generation Prompt:**

"Illustrate a scene capturing the application process for the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana â€“ Gramin (PMAY-G). The central character, Anil, a rural farmer from Medhatal village in Mandla district, Madhya Pradesh, is depicted at a registration desk surrounded by a welcoming government official. Anil is holding his Aadhaar card and bank passbook while looking hopeful as he interacts with the official. 

The registration desk is adorned with application forms and brochures showcasing PMAY-G benefits. Add visual elements that exemplify the eligibility criteria, like a poster of the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 data on the wall. The setting should reflect a clean, well-lit rural government office, complete with traditional decor that connects to the local architecture.

Include elements of community support in the background, such as a few fellow villagers waiting with their documents, demonstrating inclusivity and the accessibility of the application process. The scene should convey a sense of optimism and empowerment, illustrating how government support is making the application process easier and more transparent for individuals like Anil."

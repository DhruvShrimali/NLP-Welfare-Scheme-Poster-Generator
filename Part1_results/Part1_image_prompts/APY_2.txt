**Image Generation Prompt:**

Create an illustration depicting 'Raju the Farmer,' a hardworking man in his early 30s, actively engaging in the application process for the Atal Pension Yojana (APY) at a registration desk in a government office. Raju should look determined and hopeful as he interacts with a friendly government official who is assisting him. The official should be a middle-aged woman with a warm smile, wearing a traditional Indian attire, guiding Raju through the application steps.

In the scene, prominently feature the required documents: Rajuâ€™s Aadhaar card, a bank passbook, and a filled application form laid out on the desk. The setting should have a rural feel, with decorations that resonate with the local culture, such as traditional wall art or potted plants. 

Include a digital device nearby, like a tablet or computer, displaying information about the APY scheme to emphasize the accessibility of the process. 

The atmosphere should be encouraging and welcoming, highlighting the ease and support provided in the registration process, while still maintaining elements that reflect Raju's journey from concern to hope for better financial security in his old age. Overall, focus on conveying a sense of community and optimism as he takes a significant step towards securing his future.

### Write-up 1: Beneficiary and Problem Statement

The beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) expansion are senior citizens aged 70 years and above across India. This demographic faces several challenges, particularly limited access to affordable healthcare services. They often belong to socio-economically vulnerable groups and may struggle with chronic illnesses that require hospitalization. Additionally, the rising cost of health insurance and medical care can create significant financial burdens for these individuals, leaving them at risk of not receiving necessary medical attention. With this expansion, the AB PM-JAY scheme aims to alleviate these challenges by providing essential health coverage.

### Write-up 2: Application Process and Benefits

To benefit from the AB PM-JAY scheme, senior citizens will receive a new, distinct identification card under the program. This coverage is available without the need for an income test, directly benefiting all eligible seniors. The scheme provides health insurance coverage of up to Rs 5 lakh per family per year for both those already enrolled in AB PM-JAY and those who join newly. Senior citizens within families already utilizing AB PM-JAY will receive an additional top-up coverage of Rs 5 lakh annually. Moreover, those not previously covered will also enjoy up to Rs 5 lakh in health coverage. Additionally, seniors who benefit from other public health schemes have the option to either maintain their existing coverage or switch to AB PM-JAY, which is also applicable for those with private insurance.

### Write-up 3: Outcome and Impact

The expected outcomes of the AB PM-JAY expansion include enhanced access to healthcare services for 6 crore senior citizens, significantly reducing their financial burden associated with medical expenses. This initiative will improve medical access, as all eligible seniors will benefit from up to Rs 5 lakh in health coverage. As a result, it is anticipated that unnecessary health complications due to lack of treatment will decrease, leading to better health outcomes and improved quality of life among seniors. Furthermore, the scheme aims to foster a healthier elderly population, encouraging longevity and enhancing their ability to participate actively in society, overall contributing to a more robust public health framework in India.

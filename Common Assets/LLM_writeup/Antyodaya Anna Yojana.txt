**Write-up 1: Beneficiary and Problem Statement**

The beneficiaries of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) are the poorest families in India, particularly those classified as Below Poverty Line (BPL). These families face significant challenges, including food insecurity, which affects their overall health, nutrition, and day-to-day livelihood. With limited financial resources, many beneficiaries struggle to afford sufficient food, leading to hunger and malnutrition. The scheme targets those headed by vulnerable individuals such as widows, the elderly, or persons with disabilities, who lack stable support or income, and thus are particularly at risk of poverty and food deprivation.

**Benefits of the Scheme:**

**Write-up 3: Outcome and Impact**

The expected outcomes of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana are substantial improvements in food security and nutrition among the poorest populations in India. By expanding access to food grains at subsidised prices, the scheme aims to reduce hunger and alleviate poverty. The increase from 25 kg to 35 kg of food grains per family per month enhances the dietary intake of approximately 15 crore individuals, thus improving their overall health and quality of life. 

Additionally, the project fosters a sense of inclusiveness for marginalized communities, helping to stabilize their livelihoods and increase resilience against economic fluctuations. Furthermore, with the government’s commitment to increasing the AAY budget to meet rising demand, there is an optimistic outlook for effectively supporting vulnerable families and breaking the cycle of poverty in the long term.

**Write-up 1: Beneficiary and Problem Statement**

The primary beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) are women and children from Below Poverty Line (BPL) households in India, particularly those living in rural areas. These families have traditionally relied on harmful cooking fuels such as firewood, dried cow dung, and agricultural waste, which release toxic smoke containing particulate matter and harmful chemicals. This exposure is associated with serious health risks, including respiratory diseases and lung cancer. Women often have to endure the strenuous task of collecting firewood from remote areas, compromising both their health and personal safety. By providing universal access to clean cooking fuel, the PMUY aims to alleviate these challenges and improve the quality of life for these marginalized families.

**Write-up 2: Application Process and Benefits**

To apply for the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, a woman from a BPL household must fill out the Know Your Customer (KYC) application form and submit it to the nearest LPG distributor, along with proof of address, a ration card, Aadhaar number, and bank account details. Upon successful application, beneficiaries receive a cash assistance of â‚¹1,600, which covers the cost of a cylinder, pressure regulator, LPG hose, consumer card, and installation charges. Additionally, a loan option is also available to cover the costs of a stove and the first refill, enhancing affordability for the beneficiaries.

**Write-up 3: Outcome and Impact**

The expected outcomes of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana include significant improvements in the health and safety of women and children, who will no longer be exposed to the harmful smoke generated by traditional cooking fuels. The scheme seeks to reduce respiratory diseases and improve the overall quality of life, allowing women to spend more time on education, income-generating activities, and family well-being. The initiative is designed to empower women socially and economically by providing them with a clean cooking fuel solution and helping to bridge gender inequality. With over 8 crore connections provided, the PMUY is set to transform the lives of millions, moving towards a future of universal access to clean energy.

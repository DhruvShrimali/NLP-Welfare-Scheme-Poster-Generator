### Write-up 1: Beneficiary and Problem Statement

The primary beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) are pregnant women and lactating mothers from socially and economically disadvantaged sections of society. These women often face significant challenges during and after pregnancy, including the financial strain of maternity-related expenses. Many are unemployed or underemployed and experience wage-loss due to their pregnancy. Additionally, cultural biases against female children contribute to a lower sex ratio, leading to stigmatization and discrimination. The PMMVY aims to address these issues by providing crucial support to mothers, particularly in ensuring the well-being of girl children.

### Write-up 3: Outcome and Impact

The expected outcomes of the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana are multifaceted. By providing maternity benefits and financial assistance, the scheme helps alleviate the financial burden on pregnant women and new mothers, supporting them during a critical life phase. It fosters better health behavior by encouraging antenatal check-ups and vaccinations, ultimately improving maternal and child health outcomes.

Moreover, the initiative aims to promote a positive attitude towards the girl child, contributing to improved sex ratios by discouraging female feticide. This effort is crucial for changing societal perceptions about gender and ensuring that every child, regardless of gender, is valued and nurtured. By empowering mothers and improving health outcomes, PMMVY has the potential to create a more equitable society and enhance the overall well-being of families belonging to disadvantaged sections.

Universal Access to Clean Fuel
Freedom from Smoke

I was born in a very humble abode where there
were no windows and only one door. My mother
used firewood for cooking. Sometimes, the smoke
was so dense that we could not even see our
mother when she served us food. This is how
I ate in my childhood. So, I have experienced and
lived the pain of these mothers and children.
I want to free these mothers from such a
painful life. And that is why we resolved to provide
clean cooking fuel to 8 crore families.
Narendra Modi
Prime Minister of India

Introduction

The daily act of cooking has been a major health hazard for millions of women in
India, especially in rural areas, due to the use of traditional fuels.

Till 2014, about 100 million households in India were deprived of clean LPG fuel
and used traditional biomass fuels such firewood, dried cow dung, agricultural
waste, charcoal etc. as cooking fuel. The toxic smoke emitted by these fuels
contains particulate matter and harmful chemicals that are harmful to eyes and
lungs, causing acute and chronic respiratory illness, such as pneumonia and
chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. The smoke also contains carcinogenic
elements causing lung cancer. Apart from women, children also suffered from this
harmful kitchen smoke.
*

According to Late Professor Kirk Smith , Professor of Global
Environmental Health, University of California, Berkeley, inhaling this
harmful smoke is equivalent to smoking 400 cigarettes per hour.

Women and children also had to walk afar to collect firewood in remote and
secluded places, which was not only a strenuous task but also risky from the point
of view of personal safety.

Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) was launched to protect Indian women
from this drudgery and make their lives healthier.

Need for PMUY

Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY)
was launched with the aim to safeguard
the health of women and children by
providing them with clean cooking fuel,
so that they don’t have to compromise
their health in smoky kitchens.

The PMUY scheme was launched by
Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra
Modi from Ballia district in Uttar
Pradesh on 1st May 2016. Public Sector

Oil Marketing Companies were initially
given a target of providing deposit-free
LPG connection to adult woman
members of 5 Crore BPL households
by 31st March 2019. Rs. 8000 Crore was
allocated for the scheme.

The scheme target was subsequently
revised to 8 Crore LPG connections,
with an additional budgetary provision
of Rs. 4800 Crore.

Financial Support Under the Scheme
One of the constraints of using LPG on
a sustained basis was the high upfront
cost. To ease this constraint, a cash
assistance of Rs. 1600 per connection
was provided to the beneficiaries by
Government of India (GoI) which
covered the cost of a cylinder, pressure
regulator, LPG hose, consumer card

and Installation charges for availing the
connection. Besides this, an option for
loan was also extended to the
beneficiaries to cover the cost of stove
and first refill. A total of 6.24 Cr
Households (78%) availed the loan
facility.

Reaching out to the deprived families
was a mammoth task as they were
mostly residing in the rural and far-flung
areas. The challenge was to correctly
identify the beneficiary so that the
benefits reach the deprived households.
The LPG distributors and the field force
of OMCs worked in close coordination

to identify the beneficiaries and enroll
them under the scheme. Besides, a
district nodal officer was appointed by
Oil Marketing Companies in each
district to monitor the progress of the
scheme at grassroots and ensure
smooth implementation.

LPG Panchayat

Since the PMUY beneficiaries were
mostly first-time users of LPG, they
were apprehensive about the safe
handling of LPG at their homes. Hence,
creating awareness about safe use of
LPG amongst PMUY beneficiaries was
of primary importance.

LPG Panchayats were envisioned to
discuss safe handling of LPG, and
benefits of using LPG over traditional
fuels. Designed as community

meetings, the Panchayats served as
platforms for LPG consumers to interact
with each other, share experiences, and
promote mutual learning.

It brings together various stakeholders
from the LPG ecosystem such as
OMC officials, distributors, mechanics,
deliverymen, etc. LPG Panchayats
provide opportunity for consumers to
interact with them and share their
questions and apprehensions.

Key Themes addressed by LPG Panchayats:
Health

According to WHO estimates, with
nearly 5 lakh deaths every year, indoor
air pollution accounts for the highest
number of deaths in India, after high
blood pressure. Using LPG saves
beneficiaries from respiratory diseases.

Economic Cost

The burden of gathering, processing
and transporting of wood as kitchen fuel
generally falls on women and girl
children, contributing to drudgery. Since
cooking continues to be women’s
responsibility primarily, they end up
compromising on the time spent on
housework, paid work, and leisure in
order to meet the energy needs of the
household. In case of young girls, this
translates into poor attendance and
even dropping out of school.

Using LPG saves time spent on cooking
and allied activities, which when put to
productive and economic use, can lead
to women achieving a better economic
status, both within the household and in
the larger community.

Safety

The benefits of LPG can be realized only
with safe and responsible use. To avoid
untoward incidents, each beneficiary is
given a safety card that details the
Do's and Don'ts of LPG use.

Environment

Using traditional cooking fuels such as
firewood and coal puts immense
pressure on the environment as well.
The soot and smoke produced by biomass is damaging. Use of bio-mass also
contributes to deforestation and overall
degradation of the environment.

Empowerment

Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana was
launched with the aim of providing
women their right: right to clean energy,
and right to a life free from drudgery,
smoke & ill health. Since its launch, the
scheme has been slowly and steadily
changing the lives of millions of women
across the country.

Improvement in LPG Coverage
With the release of 8 Crore LPG
connections under the scheme in such
a short duration of time, the LPG
coverage in the country has also
increased significantly.

st
improved to 99.8%. as on 1 April 2021,
st
as compared to 62% as on 1 May 2016.

PMUY has transformed the lives of
8 crore poor women in our country.

Women in the states of Uttar
Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar,

Addressing Affordability - Accessibility Adaptability

The objective of providing clean energy
to PMUY beneficiaries relied on three
pillars – Affordability, Accessibility and
Adaptability.

Affordability : As PMUY beneficiaries

hail from low socio-economic
background, the high cost of LPG refill
is often a deterrent for purchasing LPG
refills. To ensure sustained use of
LPG, the following initiatives were
undertaken:
1. Deferment of loan recovery through
subsidy

2. Refill Option with 5 kg cylinder to
reduce the upfront cost of the refill.

3. Free Refill Scheme option under
Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan
Package

Accessibility: PMUY beneficiaries

mostly hail from rural and remote areas,
at a considerable distance from their

14 Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana

LPG distributor. For ensuring better
accessibility, following steps were taken:

1. Commissioning of more than 6000
new LPG distributors

2. Booking facilities through Common
Service.

3. Augmentation of LPG Bottling
Capacity
4. Commissioning of Additional
Bottling Plants

Adaptability: Mass campaigns were

undertaken to improve awareness
about the benefits of the scheme and of
using LPG.

SHGs/ SDPs/ NGOs were engaged to
carry out extensive door- to-door
campaign in the rural areas which
further promoted the adoption of LPG.

Global Recognition of The Scheme
The scheme has been applauded by
the International Energy Agency (IEA),
as a "major achievement" in improving
the environment and health of women.

Providing

access to LPG

across India by

2020 is a major

achievement. It is

not an energy issue,
it is an economic
issue, it is a

social issue
Fatih Birol
IEA Executive Director

PMUY also garnered praise in a report
by World Health Organisation (WHO) in
2018. The Report mentions that while
air pollution levels across the world are
hovering around the danger mark,
there are a few countries that have
taken the matter seriously and have
initiated steps to tackle it.

“While the latest data show
ambient air pollution levels are
still dangerously high in most
parts of the world, they also show
some positive progress. Countries
are taking measures to tackle
and reduce air pollution from
particulate matter. For example,
in just two years, India’s Pradhan
Mantri Ujjwala Yojana Scheme has
provided some 37 million women
living below the poverty line with
free LPG connections to support
them to switch to clean household
energy use,” the WHO report said.

Impact of the Scheme

PMUY has had an enormous impact on the lives of the beneficiaries and their
families. The benefits of adopting LPG often extend to subsequent generations of
the families.
Some of the tangible benefits accrued are:
Significant direct health benefits
for the families and freedom from
bronchitis, asthma, influenza,
pneumonia, tuberculosis and other
respiratory disease and infections
caused by exposure to household
air pollution (HAP)

LPG has led to reduced drudgery
in collection of fuel and cooking.
This has opened up opportunities
for alternative engagement in
education, other productive
labour and social activities- small
business, part-time jobs, social
activities, other opportunities to
get financial benefits, spend
quality time for family welfare and
education for self/ children.

Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana

Reduction in emissions of
pollutants such as methane,
black carbon and organic
carbon released by
inefficient solid fuels.

As the connections are released
in the name of the women in the
household, PMUY has
empowered them both socially
and economically.

By empowering women, PMUY
has been able to bridge the
gender inequality with respect
to rights, access, and
economic empowerment.

Way Forward

PMUY is one of the stepping stones in
the nation's journey to clean energy. The
scheme has successfully freed more
than 8 Crore women from the black and
smoky kitchens.

Ujjwala, as it is popularly known, has
now become a second name for women
emancipation and empowerment.

In its relentless pursuit to free
remaining women from the drudgery
and smoke of unclean fuels, the
government has now announced the
second phase of Ujjwala. An additional
One Crore PMUY connections will be
released under "Ujjwala 2.0" by the
PSU OMCs.This will soon usher in an
era of universal access to clean
cooking fuels.

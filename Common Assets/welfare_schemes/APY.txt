Atal Pension Yojana (APY)1 – Details of the Scheme
1.

Introduction

1.1

The Government of India is extremely concerned about the old age income

security of the working poor and is focused on encouraging and enabling them to join
the National Pension System (NPS). To address the longevity risks among the
workers in unorganised sector and to encourage the workers in unorganised sector
to voluntarily save for their retirement, who constitute 88% of the total labour force of
47.29 crore as per the 66th Round of NSSO Survey of 2011-12, but do not have any
formal pension provision, the Government had started the Swavalamban Scheme in
2010-11. However, coverage under Swavalamban Scheme is inadequate mainly due
to lack of guaranteed pension benefits at the age of 60.
1.2

The Government announced the introduction of universal social security

schemes in the Insurance and Pension sectors for all Indians, specially the poor and
the under-privileged, in the Budget for the year 2015-16. Therefore, it has been
announced that the Government will launch the Atal Pension Yojana (APY), which
will provide a defined pension, depending on the contribution, and its period. The
APY will be focussed on all citizens in the unorganised sector, who join the National
Pension System (NPS) administered by the Pension Fund Regulatory and
Development Authority (PFRDA). Under the APY, the subscribers would receive the
fixed minimum pension of Rs. 1000 per month, Rs. 2000 per month, Rs. 3000 per
month, Rs. 4000 per month, Rs. 5000 per month, at the age of 60 years, depending
on their contributions, which itself would be based on the age of joining the APY. The
minimum age of joining APY is 18 years and maximum age is 40 years. Therefore,
minimum period of contribution by any subscriber under APY would be 20 years or
more. The benefit of fixed minimum pension would be guaranteed by the
Government. The APY would be introduced from 1st June, 2015.

All bank account holders under the eligible category may join APY with auto-

debit facility to accounts, leading to reduction in contribution collection charges. The

subscribers should keep the required balance in their savings bank accounts on the
stipulated due dates to avoid any late payment penalty. Due dates for monthly
contribution payment is arrived based on the deposit of first contribution amount. In
case of repeated defaults for specified period, the account is liable for foreclosure
and the GoI co-contributions, if any shall be forfeited. Also any false declaration
about his/her eligibility for benefits under this scheme for whatsoever reason, the
entire government contribution shall be forfeited along with the penal interest. For

disputes in the long-term. The subscribers are required to opt for a monthly pension
from Rs. 1000 - Rs. 5000 and ensure payment of stipulated monthly contribution
regularly. The subscribers can opt to decrease or increase pension amount during
the course of accumulation phase, as per the available monthly pension amounts.

APY which would invariably record the guaranteed pension amount, due date of
contribution payment, PRAN etc.

of government Co-Contribution of 1 year, then the Government co-contribution under
APY would be available only 4 years and so on. Existing Swavalamban beneficiaries
opting out from the proposed APY will be given Government co-contribution till 201617, if eligible, and the NPS Swavalamban continued till such people attained the age
of exit under that scheme.

migration. Those subscribers may also approach the nearest authorised bank branch
for shifting their Swavalamban account into APY with PRAN details.

The Swavalamban subscribers who are beyond the age of 40 and do not wish
